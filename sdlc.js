/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the features that are necessary to perform the end goal in the program are defined, as well as identifying any possible problems that may present themselves during the development proccess and how to solve them."
const design = "This is the third step in which, the way way the program will look and function will be laid out. Examples of this are designing the UI, determining how it will integrate information with a database, how it will work with other programs, etc."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step in which the code is written."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step in which the code is run to make sure that there aren't any issues before it is deployed, and then the code is deployed and made available to the intended user."
const maintain = "This is the final step in which any necessary changes are made when bugs present themselves."
